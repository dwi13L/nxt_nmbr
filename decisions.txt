The application uses 3 Tier Architecture namely
+ Controller
+ Service
+ Data Access Layer
    to maintain seperation of concerns

Controller is writtern to the service specification (interface) and not the implementation, thereby reducing tight coupling.

+ FetchNextNumber API
    - Error handling is done in the Controller itself to keep the application short and simple but ideally must be implemented using AOP

    + "getNewValue" will find the next number in at the most 9 iterations implying a time complexity of O(k) = O(1).
    + 'recursiveSumOfDigits' method has a time complexity of O(1)
    + Therefore making the 'fetchNextNumber' method pretty efficient

+ Essential unit testing is done but not exhaustively due to time constraint
